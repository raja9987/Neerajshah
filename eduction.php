                    <p>CARE India’s ‘Girl Education Program’ (GEP) has been working for 25 years to ensure quality elementary education for children, especially girls and those from marginalized communities, to help them become the leaders and changemakers of the future. We see education as an imperative tool for girls to realize their maximum potential by gaining crucial skills and dispositions that set them on the path of social and economic empowerment.</p>
                    <p>Our girls education programmes and projects in India work through building learning ecosystems that are inclusive, gender conscious, and safe for all. We work with various stakeholders to champion the importance of girl child education and mobilize resources through online donations in India and other strategies. Our education initiatives work in accordance with the Right to Education Act (2009) and National Education Policy 2020.</p>
